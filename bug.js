This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is successfully opened. This is inconsistent and makes it hard to reliably handle the initial URL of the app.  The issue is intermittent and not easily reproducible.
